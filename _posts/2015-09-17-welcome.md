Check out the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus) and [schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/schedule). Also make sure to enroll in the [Rosalind course](http://rosalind.info/classes/enroll/bfbdf38794/) to do homework for next week (make sure you register for an account before clicking the link). You can then access the class [here](http://rosalind.info/classes/238/).

For homework, make sure you submit a solution _after_ you solved the problem. There is a button to press once your solution has been accepted, which will lead you to a separate page. These will be visible to the class as a whole, and we'll review them each Thursday. Be prepared to disucss your solution and give feedback on others'. Don't bother submitting the INI1 problem :)
