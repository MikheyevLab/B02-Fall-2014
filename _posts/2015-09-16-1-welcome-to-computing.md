## Installing a Linux Virtual Machine (VM)

If you have Linux running on your laptop you don't need to follow this step. You are already a pro. Otherwise follow [these instructions](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox). They are for Windows, but should work analagously on the Mac.

## Navigating the command line

## Install python

## Installing software from source

# Homework

These are exercises to be finished by next week's class.
