So, I tried to grow out bacteria from the phage experiment, but nothing grew after two days. I think we cooked them pretty good.

You can find readings for next week by [Drake](http://www.pnas.org/content/88/16/7160) and [Lynch](https://secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/action/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Ftrends%2Fgenetics%2Fpdf%2FS0168-9525%2810%2900103-4.pdf&rc=0&code=cell-site), to be read in the order of publication.

Here are the questions for discussion:

- How does one estimate mutation rate?
- Why should there be an optimum mutation rate?
- Contrast the models of Drake and Lynch. What forces to the two models assume act on the genomes?
- According to Lynch, why do the patterns differ for non-eukaryotes and for cellular organisms (Figure 1 in his paper)?
- What is the 'paradox of variation', and what is Lynch's answer to it?
- Why are germline mutations less common than somatic mutations?
- Why might you expect less fidelity for transcription than for DNA replication?
