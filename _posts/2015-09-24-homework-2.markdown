# due next Thursday (October 1st)

- Do the new set of Rosalind problems. Some of them are quite a bit harder, so start early.
- In addition, for extra credit, carry out the following simulation:
  - Imagine that you have a finite population with or organisms with a really long genome
  - Population size is constant
  - Genomes are copied into the next generation with replacement (*i.e.*, more than one offspring possible)
  - Mutations are introduced in each replication event with some probability *u*
  - **Question**: What is the probability that a new mutation will become fixed (become the only allele) in this population as a function of *u* as time goes to infinity?
  - Send code and answer to Sasha.

## Don't forget to post your solutions when you solved a problem on Rosalind

- After submit your correct response, you'll see a "Solutions" button. Click it and write your code.
- Make sure it is legible when you've submitted it.
- You can use \`\`\` before and after code blocks to turn on syntax highlighting.
